# Privacy Policy for NachoGPT

**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025  
**Effective Date:** October 21, 2025

## Overview

NachoGPT is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension handles data.

## Data Collection

**NachoGPT does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

### What We Store Locally

All data is stored exclusively on your device using your browser's local storage or sync storage:

- **Prompts:** Your custom prompt text and titles
- **Chips:** Your organized prompt collections
- **Settings:** Color preferences and storage mode selection
- **Quick Pick Configuration:** Your 10 customizable quick-pick buttons

### Storage Options

You can choose between two storage modes:

1. **Sync Storage (Default)**
   - Data syncs across devices signed into the same browser account
   - Limited to 100KB
   - Uses browser's built-in sync functionality (Chrome Sync, Firefox Sync, etc.)
   - We do NOT have access to this data

2. **Local Storage**
   - Data stays only on your current device
   - Unlimited storage
   - Never leaves your device

## Data Transmission

**NachoGPT makes no automatic network requests.**

- No analytics
- No tracking pixels
- No telemetry
- No crash reporting
- No usage statistics
- No external API calls

The extension itself never initiates network activity. Data transfer only occurs when:
- You export a `.chip` file (saved to your device)
- You import a `.chip` file (read from your device)
- Browser sync (if using Sync Storage mode) - handled entirely by your browser
- You manually click external links in the extension (e.g., social media links)

## Permissions Explained

NachoGPT requests minimal permissions:

### 1. Storage Permission
- **Why:** Save your prompts, chips, and settings
- **Scope:** Only accessible by NachoGPT
- **Data:** Never sent to external servers

### 2. Host Permissions (AI Chat Sites)
- **Why:** Detect input fields and insert prompts
- **Sites:** chat.openai.com, chatgpt.com, claude.ai, gemini.google.com, grok.com, x.com, copilot.microsoft.com, you.com, poe.com
- **Action:** Only inserts text when you explicitly click a prompt
- **Note:** On x.com, the extension only activates when Grok chat interface is detected

## What We Can See

NachoGPT can only:
- Detect input fields on AI chat sites
- Insert text you explicitly select
- Read/write to browser storage on your device

NachoGPT **CANNOT:**
- See your chat conversations
- Track your browsing history
- Access files on your computer (except when you explicitly import)
- Send data to external servers
- Read data from other extensions
- Access your personal information

## Third-Party Services

**NachoGPT uses NO third-party services:**
- No Google Analytics
- No advertising networks
- No crash reporting services
- No content delivery networks (CDNs)
- No external JavaScript libraries

## Children's Privacy

NachoGPT does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13. The extension is safe for all ages.

## Data Security

Since all data stays on your device:
- Your prompts are as secure as your browser
- No risk of data breaches on our end (we don't have your data)
- You control access via your device's security
- You can delete all data by uninstalling the extension

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

### Access
All your data is visible in the extension popup interface.

### Export
You can export any chip as a `.chip` file at any time.

### Delete
- Delete individual prompts or chips in the extension
- Delete all data by uninstalling the extension
- Clear browser storage at `chrome://settings/siteData`

### Portability
Export your chips and import them elsewhere or share with others.
